# CRUD-JavaScript
![ screenshot of entry list](/docs/Capture.PNG)

### Motivation
After learning Basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript, I wanted to use my acquired knowledge to build a simple webpage which includes Create, Read, Update and Delete operation.

### Features
* You can add a student entry.
* You also can find, update, or delete any student based on their ID 
* You can see the list of all entry.

### How to run
>   open the `index.html` file with any of your preferred browser

### Improvements to make
* I used local storage to store the records. Instead a real database can be used.  
* A more appropiate form group can be used.
* Validation of Emaila and Phone Number can be improved.
